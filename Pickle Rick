As always, we start with an nmap scan:
Host is up (0.34s latency).
Not shown: 998 closed tcp ports (reset)
PORT   STATE SERVICE
22/tcp open  ssh
80/tcp open  http
this time we just found 2 running services on the target host.
using curl to get the contents of the webserver running on port 80, we already got our first username:

<!--
Note to self, remember username!
Username: [redacted]
-->

doing a directory fuzzing, we find that there is some interesting directories:
assets                  [Status: 301, Size: 315, Words: 20, Lines: 10, Duration: 337ms]
login                   [Status: 200, Size: 882, Words: 89, Lines: 26, Duration: 345ms]
portal                  [Status: 302, Size: 0, Words: 1, Lines: 1, Duration: 344ms]

while I was waiting the fuzzing to finish, I tried curl into robots.txt, and for my surprise there was a string, that might be into something for later.

to access portal we need to login, when we do so, we can view a command panel, with some commands blocked, inspecting the page we find a base64 encoded message
turns out it was a rabbit hole:
echo "Vm1wR1UxTnRWa2RUV0d4VFlrZFNjRlV3V2t0alJsWnlWbXQwVkUxV1duaFZNakExVkcxS1NHVkliRmhoTVhCb1ZsWmFWMVpWTVVWaGVqQT0==" | base64 -d | base64 -d | base64 -d | base64 -d | base64 -d | base64 -d | base64 -d
base64: invalid input
base64: invalid input
rabbit hole

on the command pannel directory, we can list some files:
Sup3rS3cretPickl3Ingred.txt
assets
clue.txt
denied.php
index.html
login.php
portal.php
robots.txt

with curl on http://10.10.178.223/Sup3rS3cretPickl3Ingred.txt, we get the first flag.
following the clue of the file clue.txt, we can see the contents from the home page of rick:
second ingredients
which has the second flag, we can get it with:
less /home/rick/second\ ingredients

while we were trying to find a way in, I've noticed that we are able to run any command as sudo without password:

User www-data may run the following commands on ip-10-10-178-223.eu-west-1.compute.internal:
    (ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL

now we can see the contents of /root
3rd.txt
snap

for the last, we can get the last flag with:
sudo less /root/3rd.txt
3rd ingredients: [redacted]
